Difrrence between final ,finally and finalize
final- It is a modifier can be used with
        class:- final class Abc{} when class decalered with final modifier in can not be inherited or it cannot be subclass.

		finalexample.java:6: error: cannot inherit from final finalExample
		class finalInit extends finalExample


	method:- final method cannot be overridden, child class cannot override final method of parent class. 

			finalexample.java:33: error: show() in finalInit cannot override show() in finalExample
                        public void show()



        variable :- varibale decalred as final cannot be changed or its value cannot be changed was initialized.it can be
			used with intance , local and static variable.


finally:-try{risky code that may cause exception}
	  catch(Exception h)
           {exception handling code}
           finally
             {cleanup code related to try block closing the connection
		
               }


finalize:-
unreffrenced object can  two types

new Student(); :- it is eligible for garabage collector.
Student s1=new Student();
s1=null;

it is also eligible garbage collector.
Genrally garbage collector is called by the jvm, whenever jvm feels there are objects (unrefrenced object) which need removed in order  to realese the memory.
however we can request jvm to call garbage collector explicitly but there is no gurantee jvm will accept our request or not.

Garbage collector can be called manually in two ways 

1.by using System class
2.by using Runtime class

whenever garabge collector is called GC executes finalize method before removing unrefrenced object from the memory.
Gc calls finalize method only once for the unrefrenced and for a given object.


protype:-

protected void finalize() throws Throwable


by using Runtime class
