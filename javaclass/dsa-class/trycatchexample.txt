three ways of writng Exception Message
1.printStackTrace()

when we need all three information  i-name of exception
				   ii-Description of exception
				   iii-stack trace info of exception



2.Refrence of (Exception ex) class or its Sub class

we need only two info name and Decription of exception

s.o.p(ex);
s.o.p(ex.toString());

3.getMessage();
when we need only description of exception.


why do e need mutiple catch block for single try block

common mistake programmmer do while handling exception
try block
{
statement 1
statement 2
statement 3
.
.
.
.
.
statement 100


}catch(....Exception e)
size of try block should contain as minimum statement as possible.

try
{
statement 1

}catch(ArthematicException e)
{}

try
{
statement 2

}catch(.........Exception e)
{}
during exception handling exception may occur in try block , catch block  and finally block.



try catch finally block
----> when there is no exception first try will excute and then fianlly will execute.
-----> when there is an exception is in try block  then catch will execute and lastly finally will execute.

finally{}


package javaclass;

public class ExampleFinally {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try{
            //case1
            //create db connection
            //read data from database
            //close the connection
            //if an exceeption occur while reading the data from database then exception will ocuure and conection will never close.
            //in this connection will not be able to close even if we handle the exception properly.

            //case2
            //create db connection

            //if an exceeption occur while reading the data from database then exception will ocuure and conection will never close.
            //in this connection will not be able to close even if we handle the exception properly.
            //if an exception not occur then catch will never execute

            //case1
            //create db connection
            //read data from database

            //if an exceeption occur while reading the data from database then exception will ocuure and conection will never close.
            //in this connection will not be able to close even if we handle the exception properly.
        }
        catch{
             //case2
            //close the connection


        }
        finally
        {
            //case3

            //close the connection

            exeception will occur or not finally will execute.

        }
    }
}

--->does finally block always execute
